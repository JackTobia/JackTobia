# Jack Tobia
### About Me
I am Jack Tobia, a Senior at Tufts University majoring in Computer Science and Mathematics.
Passionate about software engineering, I thrive in challenging environments, with a drive
to create innovative solutions and tackle complex problems through code. My long-term goal
is to learn and apply my skills in real-world scenarios and to bring about positive change.

### Projects
#### Project 1: Monty Hall Problem
Description: A Python program program is a simulation of the Monty Hall Problem, with the
ability to play the game manually or simulate a bunch of games. It aligns with how the
original game was played in Letâ€™s Make a Deal for decades, and thus there are certain
strategies that work better than others. There are options to either play the game yourself
or simulate a set of games. In both modes, you are able to modify the game so that there are
a different number of doors. In the play mode, you get to actually participate in the game,
trying to guess which door has the car behind it. In the simulation mode, you can input the
number of simulated games you want to run, and it will return statistics for four different
strategies, showing which ones worked best in that given number of simulations.

#### Project 2: Minesweeper (IN PROGRESS)
Description: A C++ program that gives you a fun game of minesweeper in your terminal.

### Skills
Programming Languages: Python, C++, C, HTML, CSS, SQL, and AMD Assembly.
